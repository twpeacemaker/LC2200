load:
  best fit
  first fit
  make PCB /w stack space add to the running queue
mem:
  no change
cpu
  add the PID of the current process to cpu
step:

run:
  changes listed in step
freemem:
  When memory is freed up, if there are two blocks of free memory next to each
  other, they should be coalesced as one block.

jobs

kill:

exit:
  no change

configuration file:
  needs to be added

The process control block (PCB):
  PC = 0; is the current pc
  registers[];
  the starting address of the program in memory
  the ending address of the program in memory

IN/OUT:
  have to add the PID of the program along with the message after halted

prog13:
  1                       VAR 9
  2 0x00000000 0x70000000 HALT

prog14:
  1                       VAR 11
  2 0x00000000 0x70000000 HALT


1. Test first fit
  jobs
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 2
  kill 4
  load test/prog12

  the program should be inserted between 1 and 3

2. Test best fit
  jobs
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 2
  kill 4
  load test/prog12
  freemem

  the program should insert between 3 and 5

3. test that stack can be separated from prog

  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 2
  load test/prog9
  freemem

  the program should be loaded between 1 and 3 but stack will be added to the
  end of memory

4. test jobs prints correctly
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  jobs

  the program should correctly display the jobs in the correct formate

5. test if freemem prints correctly
  load test/prog12
  freemem
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  freemem

  the free mem should be broken up appropriate to how they are loaded and killed

6. test if free mem correctly consolidates freemem that is adjacent to each
  other
  freemem
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 1
  freemem
  kill 2

  freemem should reflect all of memory free and correctly added the
  adjacent freemem blocks

7. test kill at the begining of the queue

  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  jobs
  kill 1
  jobs

  the prog should be removed from beginning

8. test kill start middle of the queue

  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  jobs
  kill 2
  jobs

the prog should be removed from the middle of the list

9. test kill start end of the queue

  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  jobs
  kill 3
  jobs

the prog should be removed from the end

10. test the config file
  config
  should reflect the values given in the .lc_config

11. test when prog is loaded and no other processes are added that it
    makes that progress ready to run ie, the PC and registers are converted
    to make that process able to run

    load prog1
    cpu
    jobs
    run

12. test that when a program is ran that it is removed from the queue

  load prog1
  run
  jobs

  the program should not be in the running queue at this point

14. (context switch) test if more then one prog is loaded, once the first
    prog is ran, the first is removed from the front and is replaced with
    the second

    load prog1
    load prog2
    jobs
    run
    jobs

    jobs should remove the first process in the second jobs statement
    and move the next to the front

15. (context switch) test if more then one prog is loaded, once the first
    prog is ran, the the cpu and registers, specifically the ($sp) is changed
    to be ready to run the new program

    load prog1
    load prog2
    jobs
    run
    cpu

    the pc should reflect the starting address of prog2 and be at the begin
    of the running queue and stack pointer should reflect the new location

16. test out of bounds of the stack(x > MAX_STACK)

17. test out of bounds of the stack(x < MIN_STACK)

18. test out of bounds of the allocated space for prog(x > MAX_PROG_LENGHT)

19. test out of bounds of the allocated space for prog(x > MIN_PROG_LENGHT)

20. test program that does not does not have space to be loaded
    NOTE: at this point it is tested that stack space and prog space can
    be separated
