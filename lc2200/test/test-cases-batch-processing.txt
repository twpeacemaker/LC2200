load:
  best fit
  first fit
  make PCB /w stack space add to the running queue
mem:
  no change
cpu
  add the PID of the current process to cpu
step:

run:
  changes listed in step
freemem:
  When memory is freed up, if there are two blocks of free memory next to each
  other, they should be coalesced as one block.

jobs

kill:

exit:
  no change

configuration file:
  needs to be added

The process control block (PCB):
  PC = 0; is the current pc
  registers[];
  the starting address of the program in memory
  the ending address of the program in memory

IN/OUT:
  have to add the PID of the program along with the message after halted

1. Test first fit
  jobs
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 2
  kill 4
  load test/prog12

  the program should be inserted between 1 and 3

2. Test best fit
  jobs
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 2
  kill 4
  load test/prog12

  the program should insert between 3 and 5

3. test that stack can be separated from prog

  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog12
  kill 2
  load test/prog9

  the program should be loaded between 1 and 3 but stack will be added to the
  end of memory

4. test jobs prints correctly
  load test/prog12
  load test/prog13

  the program should correctly display the jobs in the correct formate

5.
